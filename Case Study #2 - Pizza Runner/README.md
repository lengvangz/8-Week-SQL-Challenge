## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Situation
Danny was sold on the idea of "80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!" and wanted to Uberize it as well.  Combining these two concepts, Pizza Runner was launched. 

Danny started recruiting "runners" to deliver pizza from Pizza Runner HQ and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelancers to develop a mobile app to accept orders.

## üìã Task

Danny created an entity-relationship diagram of his database design but requires help with data cleaning and performing basic calculations to improve the direction of his runners and streamline Runner Pizza's operations.

###  Entity Relationship Diagram

### Data Cleaning & Transformation

#### ü™õ Table: customer_orders

On the `customer_orders` table below, there are:
- Blank spaces, null values, and 'null' values (as a string) in the `exclusions` column.
- Blank spaces, null values, and 'null' values (as a string) in the `extras` column.

<img width="1063" alt="image" src="https://github.com/lengvangz/images/blob/main/customer_orders%20table.png">

Steps taken to clean table:
- Create a temporary table and be the copy of the original table.
- Change the null values and 'null' values into blank spaces.

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders_temp;

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT
  order_id,
  customer_id,
	pizza_id,
	CASE
		WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null'  THEN ''
		ELSE exclusions
	END as exclusions, 
	CASE
		WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE extras
	END as extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
````

Result:
- all null values and 'null' values in both columns are now blank spaces.

#### ü™õ Table: runner_orders

On the `customer_orders` table below, there are:
- Blank spaces, null values, and 'null' values (as a string) in the `exclusions` column.
- Blank spaces, null values, and 'null' values (as a string) in the `extras` column.

<img width="1037" alt="image" src="https://github.com/lengvangz/images/blob/main/runner_order%20table.png">

Steps taken to clean `runner_order` table:
- Create a temporary table and be the copy of the original table.
- Replaced all 'null' values (as a string) into null values.
- Removed 'km', 'mins', 'minute', and 'minutes' from `distance` and `duration`.
- Replaced null values and 'null' values into blank spaces in the `cancellation` column.
- Altered data types in certain columns.

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_orders_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT
	order_id,
	runner_id,
	CASE
		WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
		ELSE pickup_time
	END AS pickup_time,
	CASE 
		WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
		WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' FROM distance)
		ELSE distance
	END as distance,
	CASE 
		WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
		WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' FROM duration)
		WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' FROM duration)
		WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' FROM duration)
		ELSE duration
	END as duration,
	CASE
		WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE cancellation
	END as cancellation 
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

ALTER TABLE runner_orders_temp 
ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE timestamp USING pickup_time::timestamp without time zone,
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE numeric USING distance::numeric,
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE integer USING duration::integer;
````

Result of the `runner_order_temp` table:
