## ‼️ Situation
Danny was sold on the idea of "80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!" and wanted to Uberize it as well.  Combining these two concepts, Pizza Runner was launched. 

Danny started recruiting "runners" to deliver pizza from Pizza Runner HQ and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelancers to develop a mobile app to accept orders.

## 📋 Task

Danny created an entity-relationship diagram of his database design but requires help with data cleaning and performing basic calculations to improve the direction of his runners and streamline Runner Pizza's operations.

###  Entity Relationship Diagram
